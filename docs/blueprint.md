- Set Scene Parameters: Allow the user to set up date, time, location, and weather conditions

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep midnight blue (#121212), evokes a sense of realism.
- Primary color: Sky blue (#79ACE3) will act as a visual anchor, but it isn't too saturated, given that our main concern is realism.
- Accent color: A vivid purple (#AC79E3) creates contrast with the primary without being too overwhelming.
- Primary font: Montserrat for headings, bold and modern.
- Secondary font: Inter for body text, readable and clean.
- Use minimalist icons that clearly represent different weather conditions and scene parameters.
- Emphasize a minimalist design with a clear division of the screen for map and controls.
- Use subtle animations when transitioning between the map view and parameter settings.
